M.Sc. Thesis Deep Hedging and Market Generation

Note that for some obsolete experiments, we used the functions GBM_simulate and LSM_american_option from the R package LSMRealOptions to generate geometric Brownian motion and apply the LSMC algorithm respectively. We were not entirely satisfied with these functions. A user willing to use this code should replace both functions by the functions GBM and LSMC we wrote ourself in Chapter 5. All experiments included in the final version of the thesis were carried out with these functions GBM and LSMC.
